        Welcome to my Website!

        Hello, my name is Cyrus Warner and I am an aspiring software developer. I recently graduated college and found that I had an interest in software development.

    <h2 class="id2">About me</h2>
        </strong>
        <p id="three">
            Currently, I am living in Iowa and attending DevCodeCamp. As of right now, I am currently a full-time student. In my free time, I work on websites and I practice my coding skills. Becoming a software developer is what I believe to be my future career.

I graduated from Southeastern Community College and decided that I would attend DevCodeCamp in hopes of learning things about software development I was unable to learn in college.

As of right now, my focus is on javascript, python, and C#. In my future I see myself learning multiple different languages to progress throughout my career.
